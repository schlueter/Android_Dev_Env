# Android Development Environment #
This repository provides a development environment for Android apps and OS. 

## Requirements ##
The development environment is intialized using (Vagrant)[http://vagrantup.com]. Also required is the (Vagrant Omnibus)[https://github.com/schisamo/vagrant-omnibus] vagrant plugin which can be installed with `vagrant plugin install install vagrant omnibus`. Once these are installed, a `vagrant up` will download and configure everything needed for android development.
